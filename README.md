# # 👋 Hi, I’m Sebastian

I’m a Data Science student focused on applied machine learning and real-world problem solving.  
I’m currently transitioning into data science, working on end-to-end projects that cover the full data science workflow, from data preparation and feature engineering to modeling and insight generation.

My background in communication and marketing helps me approach data with context, structure, and clarity when translating technical results into actionable insights.
